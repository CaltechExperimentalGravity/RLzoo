RLzoo is a collection of the most practical reinforcement learning algorithms, frameworks and applications. It is implemented with Tensorflow 2.0 and API of neural network layers in TensorLayer 2, to provide a hands-on fast-developing approach for reinforcement learning practices and benchmarks. It supports basic toy-tests like OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite with very simple configurations. Moreover, RLzoo supports robot learning benchmark environment RLBench based on Vrep/Pyrep simulator. Other large-scale distributed training framework for more realistic scenarios with Unity 3D, Mujoco, Bullet Physics, etc, will be supported in the future. A `Springer textbook <https://deepreinforcementlearningbook.org>`__ is also provided, you can get the free PDF if your institute has Springer license.
